Hi Internet, 3 months without anything. So here we go.

Finally I got my me time this weekend. Internet, tv, games, books, and no other human. Perfect.

For the sake of make this blog post deliver to you with *content*, maybe [this](https://github.com/nyelonong/httpclient) can help.

Go net/http is more than enough for http client. But believe me, you don't want to write it every time you need.

This piece of code help me a lot when I just need simple GET or POST http request.

[Header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields), [Query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string), [JSON body](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/), you named it. Handled as easy as 1, 2, 3.
