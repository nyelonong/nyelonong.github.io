*Let’s talk honestly about one of the biggest myths in computer science.*

***

![O(1)]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/O1.png)

Imagine you're in a job interview and the interviewer asks:

> "What’s the time complexity of a hashmap lookup?"

And like everyone else, you answer:

> "O(1) on average."

Seems correct, right? 
Well… not really.

Let’s break the illusion.

# 0. What Exactly Is a Hashmap?
A hashmap (or hash table) is a data structure that stores key -> value pairs and uses a hash function to decide where each key should live in memory.

Conceptually, it looks like this:

```hash(key) -> bucket index -> value```

```
    +-------------------------------+
    |        hash(key)              |   <- O(len(key))
    +-------------------------------+
                 |
                 v
+-----------------------------------------+
| bucket_index = hash & (capacity - 1)    |
+-----------------------------------------+
                 |
                 v
+-----------------------------------------+
|      load bucket pointer (L1/L2/L3)     |
+-----------------------------------------+
                 |
                 v
+-------------------------------------------+
| compare tophash[] | load keys | load vals |
| ----------------------------------------- |
| maybe go into overflow buckets...         |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

Its design aims to make:
- insert
- lookup
- delete

…run in “constant time,” hence the famous:

Hashmap operations are **O(1)**. This is true in an academic sense, but misleading in the real world.

Let’s break it down.

## 0.1 Core Structure
A hash map consists of two main components:

### The bucket array
This is an array where each element points to a *"bucket"*.

The array length is usually a power of two: 
8, 16, 32, 64, … 
This allows faster hashing using bitwise operations.

Example (size = 8):
```
index 0: bucket pointer
index 1: bucket pointer
index 2: bucket pointer
...
index 7: bucket pointer
```

### Bucket / Entry list
A bucket may contain:
- 0 entries
- 1 entry
- multiple entries (if collisions occur)

A typical entry structure:
```
entry {
    tophash
    key
    value
    overflow
}
```
## 0.2 How Lookup Works
Suppose you do:
```go
value := m["hello"]
```
Internally, It will performs:

### Step 1 - Compute hash(key)
Hash function:
```go
hash = algo.somehashfunction("hello")
```
Example:
```go
hash = 0xFA9320AABBCCDDEE
```

### Step 2 - Compute bucket index
Assume the map has **8 buckets (2^3)**:

```
bucketMask = bucketCount - 1 = 7 = 0x000...0007
```


Then:
```
index = hash & bucketMask
```

Example:
```
hash   = FA9320AABBCCDDEE
mask   = 0000000000000007
-------------------------
index = 0x6 (decimal 6)
```

So the key will be searched in bucket **#6**.

>**No memory** access has happened yet.
>This is all done in **CPU registers**.

### Step 3 - Load the Bucket Pointer
We stores an array of bucket pointers:
```go
bucketPtr := h.buckets[index]
```

Assume key always string and value always int. 
This points to a bucket struct that looks like:
```go
type bucket struct {
	tophash [8]uint8
	keys    [8]string
	values  [8]int
	overflow *bucket
}
```

Now it will inspect the tophash.

### Step 4 - Use High Bits of the Hash (tophash) to Filter Slots
Extracts the top 8 bits of the hash:
```
top = hash >> (64 - 8)    // highest 8 bits
```

Example:
```
hash = FA9320AABBCCDDEE
top  = FA
```

Then check:
```go
bucket.tophash[i] == top ?
```
If it matches -> compare actual key.

```go
bucket.key[i] == "hello" ?
```

If not -> skip slot.

This drastically accelerates lookup.

### Step 5 - If No Match Found, Follow Overflow Buckets
If none of the 8 slots in the bucket match:

```
bucket = bucket.overflow
repeat...
```

```go
key := "hello"
tophash := 0xFA

for each overflowBucket in chain:
    for i in 0..7:
        if overflowBucket.tophash[i] == tophash and overflowBucket.key[i] == key:
            return overflowBucket.values[i], true
```

## 0.3 How Insert Works
We follow the same process until we got the **bucket index (Step 2)**.

### Step 3 - Place entry into bucket
```go
bucket := buckets[bucketIndex]

// Step 1: check for empty slot in bucket
for i in 0..7:
    if bucket.tophash[i] == empty:
        use slot i
        return

// Step 2: if bucket is full, look for space in overflow chain
for each overflowBucket in chain:
    for i in 0..7:
        if overflowBucket.tophash[i] == empty:
            use this slot
            return

// Step 3: if everything full, create new overflow bucket
newOverflow := new(bucket)
lastOverflow.overflow = newOverflow

use newOverflow.slot[0]
```

Some programminng languages use linked list (**O(n)**) or balanced trees (**O(log n)**) to handle the collison

#### New Overflow Bucket
Allocates an overflow bucket and inserts the new key/value into that overflow bucket.

Criteria ```Load factor = number of entries / number of buckets```

Example:
```
8 buckets, 6 entries -> load factor = 0.75
```

When load factor exceeds a threshold (usually 75%), the hash map:
- resizes (doubles the capacity)
- rehashes all entries

Example:
- 8 -> 16 buckets to manage bitwise calculation
- all entries recompute their index
- placed into the new array

This operation is expensive (**O(n)**), but infrequent.

```

  |          spikes due to resize

  |              /  \
  |    _________/    \__________
  |   /
  +--+-----------------------------------> Number of keys

   O(1-ish)
```

# 1. Hashmaps Are Only O(1) Under Perfect Assumptions
The textbooks assume:
- perfect hash distribution
- no collisions
- infinite memory
- no CPU cache hierarchy
- constant-time memory access
- uniform allocator performance
- no resizing
- no hashing cost
- no adversarial input

That world doesn’t exist.

On real CPUs, real RAM, and real workloads: *Hashmaps behave like O(1) amortized average-time data structures.*

> Average lookup: **O(1)** 
> Worst case:     **O(n)**
