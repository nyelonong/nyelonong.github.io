Hi Internet.

Lately I feel uncomfortable with some people's act. People being racist everywhere, and it's hurt. I promise will not be racist anymore.

In the Internet age, you can get anything; even things you do not want see. And vice versa, you can give anything to others; even things that are not wanted.

As the [first verse Allah revealed](https://quran.com/96)
```
اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ
```

It is clear that Allah wants us to read, seek knowledge.
In this rainy night, I made a [simple cli application](https://github.com/nyelonong/quran) to read the Qur'an
